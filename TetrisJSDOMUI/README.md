#Tetris
####[Telerik Academy]<br>JavaScript DOM & UI Course Teamwork Project
###Goals:  

The goal of this project was to practice animation development with HTML5 Canvas and SVG, including their respective frameworks. We tried to uphold the best practices in JavaScript and satisfy the project requirements. 
###Description: 

This is a simple implementation of the famous Tetris game where the player has control over the falling shape and tries to place it on the board, in its best possible adjustment. The player gains points when a complete line of blocks is formed, the line is then removed and the game goes on. If a specified, score-related, stage in game is reached - the level is raised, so is the shapeâ€™s falling speed. The game ends when there is a board block on the highest board row. The player can afterwards save his/hers score in the high scores ranking
 
#####The game meets the following requirements: 
*	Use HTML5 Canvas or a Canvas framework like KineticJS paper.js or other
