#####[Telerik Academy]<br>JavaScript UI & DOM Course Teamwork Assignment


[**General assignment**](http://downloads.academy.telerik.com/svn/js-part2/2014/Teamwork/JS-UI-and-DOM-Teamwork-Assignment-June-2014.pdf)

**Overview**

 - [X] Create tetromino objects, add movement and rotation functionality
 - [X] Introduce game constants and variables
 - [X] Implement rendering functions (`drawBoard(), drawFallingShape(), drawMetrics()`). Modify the initial ones(if necessary). 
 - [X] Implement adding shape to board functionality (`addToBoard()`)
 - [X] Improve game physics. Fix occurring bugs when rotating shape on the board border and moving shape next to board blocks.
 - [X] Implement function to check for complete lines in board thus reordering its blocks.
 - [X] Implement function to update the score and the level.
 - [X] Implement storage to keep high scores and functionality for displaying the ranking
 - [X] Implement game controls e.g. start/pause+resume/clear ranking/custom game/toggle music
 - [X] Include more animations, styles, images etc.
 - [X] Refactor and clean code.
 - [X] Write documentation.

**Notes**<br>
* draw methods can be edited/modified as they do not interfere with the core app logic
* KineticJS may cause performance issues!
* current algorithm allows setting custom values to the game variables, which can influence the gameplay but not break the underlying structure
